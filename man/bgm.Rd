\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame or matrix with \code{n} rows and \code{p} columns
containing binary and ordinal variables for \code{n} independent observations
and \code{p} variables in the network. Regular binary and ordinal variables
are recoded as non-negative integers \code{(0, 1, ..., m)} if not already
done. Unobserved categories are collapsed into other categories after
recoding (i.e., if category 1 is unobserved, the data are recoded from
(0, 2) to (0, 1)). Blume-Capel ordinal variables are also coded as
non-negative integers if not already done. However, since ``distance'' to the
reference category plays an important role in this model, unobserved
categories are not collapsed after recoding.}

\item{variable_type}{What kind of variables are there in \code{x}? Can be a
single character string specifying the variable type of all \code{p}
variables at once or a vector of character strings of length \code{p}
specifying the type for each variable in \code{x} separately. Currently, bgm
supports ``ordinal'' and ``blume-capel''. Binary variables are automatically
treated as ``ordinal’’. Defaults to \code{variable_type = "ordinal"}.}

\item{reference_category}{The reference category in the Blume-Capel model.
Should be an integer within the range of integer scores observed for the
``blume-capel'' variable. Can be a single number specifying the reference
category for all Blume-Capel variables at once, or a vector of length
\code{p} where the \code{i}-th element contains the reference category for
variable \code{i} if it is Blume-Capel, and bgm ignores its elements for
other variable types. The value of the reference category is also recoded
when bgm recodes the corresponding observations. Only required if there is at
least one variable of type ``blume-capel''.}

\item{iter}{How many iterations should the Gibbs sampler run? The default of
\code{1e4} is for illustrative purposes. For stable estimates, it is
recommended to run the Gibbs sampler for at least \code{1e5} iterations.}

\item{burnin}{The number of iterations of the Gibbs sampler before saving its
output. Since it may take some time for the Gibbs sampler to converge to
the posterior distribution, it is recommended not to set this number too low.}

\item{interaction_prior}{The prior distribution to use for the pairwise
interaction parameters. If \code{edge_selection = TRUE} this prior is the
slab distribution. The current option for this prior is a Cauchy distribution
(\code{interaction_prior = "Cauchy"}). If there are no missing data and no
Blume-Capel variables, there is also an option to use a unit information
prior instead (\code{interaction_prior = "UnitInfo"}). The default is
(\code{interaction_prior = "Cauchy"}).}

\item{cauchy_scale}{The scale of the Cauchy distribution that is used as a
prior for the pairwise interaction parameters. Defaults to \code{2.5}.}

\item{threshold_alpha, threshold_beta}{The shape parameters of the beta-prime
prior density for the threshold parameters. Must be positive values. If the
two values are equal, the prior density is symmetric about zero. If
\code{threshold_beta} is greater than \code{threshold_alpha}, the
distribution is skewed to the left, and if \code{threshold_beta} is less than
\code{threshold_alpha}, it is skewed to the right. Smaller values tend to
lead to more diffuse prior distributions.}

\item{edge_selection}{Should the function perform Bayesian edge selection on
the edges of the MRF in addition to estimating its parameters
(\code{edge_selection = TRUE}), or should it just estimate the parameters
(\code{edge_selection = FALSE})? The default is \code{edge_selection = TRUE}.}

\item{edge_prior}{The inclusion or exclusion of individual edges in the
network is modeled with binary indicator variables that capture the structure
of the network. The argument \code{edge_prior} is used to set a prior
distribution for the edge indicator variables, i.e., the structure of the
network. Currently, two options are implemented: The Bernoulli model
\code{edge_prior = "Bernoulli"} assumes that the probability that an edge
between two variables is included is equal to \code{inclusion_probability}
and independent of other edges or variables. When
\code{inclusion_probability = 0.5}, this means that each possible network
structure is given the same prior weight. The Beta-Bernoulli model
\code{edge_prior = "Beta-Bernoulli"} assumes a beta prior for the unknown
inclusion probability with shape parameters \code{beta_bernoulli_alpha} and
\code{beta_bernoulli_beta}. If \code{beta_bernoulli_alpha = 1} and
\code{beta_bernoulli_beta = 1}, this means that networks with the same
complexity (number of edges) get the same prior weight. The default is
\code{edge_prior = "Bernoulli"}.}

\item{inclusion_probability}{The prior edge inclusion probability for the
Bernoulli model. Can be a single probability, or a matrix of \code{p} rows
and \code{p} columns specifying an inclusion probability for each edge pair.
The default is \code{inclusion_probability = 0.5}.}

\item{beta_bernoulli_alpha, beta_bernoulli_beta}{The two shape parameters of
the Beta prior density for the Bernoulli inclusion probability. Must be
positive numbers. Defaults to \code{beta_bernoulli_alpha = 1} and
\code{beta_bernoulli_beta = 1}.}

\item{adaptive}{A random walk Metropolis algorithm is used to sample from the
fully conditional posterior distributions of the pairwise interaction
parameters. This requires a variance to be specified for the prior
distribution. If there are no missing values and no ``blume-capel'' variables,
there is an option to set this variance equal to the curvature around the
posterior mode. This is the default of the bgm function, but requires the
second derivative of the pseudoposterior at its mode, which bgm cannot
determine in the case of missing data, and is not implemented for
``blume-capel'' variables. In other cases, bgm switches to an adaptive
Metropolis algorithm, which adjusts the proposal variance to the acceptance
probability of the random walk Metropolis algorithm to be close to the
optimum of \code{.234} using a Robbins-Monro-type algorithm. The user can
also select the adaptive Metropolis algorithm by default
(\code{adaptive = TRUE}).}

\item{na.action}{How do you want the function to handle missing data? If
\code{na.action = "listwise"}, listwise deletion is used. If
\code{na.action = "impute"}, missing data are imputed iteratively during the
MCMC procedure. Since imputation of missing data can have a negative impact
on the convergence speed of the MCMC procedure, it is recommended to run the
MCMC for more iterations. Also, since the numerical routines that search for
the mode of the posterior do not have an imputation option, the bgm function
will automatically switch to \code{interaction_prior = "Cauchy"} and
\code{adaptive = TRUE}.}

\item{save}{Should the function collect and return all samples from the Gibbs
sampler (\code{save = TRUE})? Or should it only return the (model-averaged)
posterior means (\code{save = FALSE})? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{display_progress}{Should the function show a progress bar
(\code{display_progress = TRUE})? Or not (\code{display_progress = FALSE})?
The default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
If \code{save = FALSE} (the default), the result is a list of class
``bgms'' containing the following matrices:
\itemize{
\item \code{gamma}: A matrix with \code{p} rows and \code{p} columns,
containing posterior inclusion probabilities of individual edges.
\item \code{interactions}: A matrix with \code{p} rows and \code{p} columns,
containing model-averaged posterior means of the pairwise associations.
\item \code{thresholds}: A matrix with \code{p} rows and \code{max(m)}
columns, containing model-averaged category thresholds. In the case of
``blume-capel'' variables, the first entry is the parameter for the linear
effect and the second entry is the parameter for the quadratic effect, which
models the offset to the reference category.
}

If \code{save = TRUE}, the result is a list of class ``bgms'' containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{gamma}: A matrix with \code{iter} rows and
\code{p * (p - 1) / 2} columns, containing the edge inclusion indicators from
every iteration of the Gibbs sampler.
\item \code{interactions}: A matrix with \code{iter} rows and
\code{p * (p - 1) / 2} columns, containing parameter states from every
iteration of the Gibbs sampler for the pairwise associations.
\item \code{thresholds}: A matrix with \code{iter} rows and
\code{sum(m)} columns, containing parameter states from every iteration of
the Gibbs sampler for the category thresholds.
}
Column averages of these matrices provide the model-averaged posterior means.

In addition to the analysis results, the bgm output lists some of the
arguments of its call. This is useful for post-processing the results.

\description{
The function \code{bgm} explores the joint pseudoposterior distribution of
parameters and possibly edge indicators for a Markov Random Field model for
mixed binary and ordinal variables.
}
\details{
Currently, bgm supports two types of ordinal variables. The regular, default,
ordinal variable type has no restrictions on its distribution. Every response
category except the first receives its own threshold parameter. The
Blume-Capel ordinal variable assumes that there is a specific reference
category, such as the ``neutral'' in a Likert scale, and responses are scored
in terms of their distance to this reference category. Specifically, the
Blume-Capel model specifies the following quadratic model for the threshold
parameters:
\deqn{\mu_{\text{c}} = \alpha \times \text{c} + \beta \times (\text{c} - \text{r})^2,}{{\mu_{\text{c}} = \alpha \times \text{c} + \beta \times (\text{c} - \text{r})^2,}}
where \eqn{\mu_{\text{c}}}{\mu_{\text{c}}} is the threshold for category c.
The parameter \eqn{\alpha}{\alpha} models a linear trend across categories,
such that \eqn{\alpha > 0}{\alpha > 0} leads to an increasing number of
observations in higher response categories and \eqn{\alpha <0}{\alpha <0}
leads to a decreasing number of observations in higher response categories.
The parameter \eqn{\beta}{\beta} models the response style in terms of an
offset with respect to the reference category \eqn{r}{r}; if \eqn{\beta<0}{\beta<0}
there is a preference to respond in the reference category (i.e., the model
introduces a penalty for responding in a category further away from the
reference_category category \code{r}), while if \eqn{\beta > 0}{\beta > 0}
there is preference to score in the extreme categories further away from the
reference_category category.

The Bayesian estimation procedure (\code{edge_selection = FALSE}) simply
estimates the threshold and pairwise interaction parameters of the ordinal
MRF, while the Bayesian edge selection procedure
(\code{edge_selection = TRUE}) also models the probability that individual
edges should be included or excluded from the model. Bayesian edge selection
imposes a discrete spike and slab prior distribution on the pairwise
interactions. By formulating it as a mixture of mutually singular
distributions, the function can use a combination of Metropolis-Hastings and
Gibbs sampling to create a Markov chain that has the joint posterior
distribution as an invariant. The current option for the slab distribution is
a Cauchy with an optional scaling parameter. If there are no missing data and
no Blume-Capel variables, there is also an option to use a unit-information
prior for the slab distribution instead. The slab distribution is also used
as the prior for the interaction parameters for Bayesian estimation. A
beta-prime distribution is used for the exponent of the category parameters.
For Bayesian edge selection, two prior distributions are implemented for the
edge inclusion variables (i.e., the prior probability that an edge is
included); the Bernoulli prior and the Beta-Bernoulli prior.
