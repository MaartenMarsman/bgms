\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame or matrix with \eqn{n_1}{n_1} rows and \code{p} columns
containing binary and ordinal responses for the first group. Regular ordinal
variables are recoded as non-negative integers \code{(0, 1, ..., m)} if not
already done. Unobserved categories are collapsed into other categories after
recoding (i.e., if category 1 is unobserved, the data are recoded from (0, 2)
to (0, 1)). Blume-Capel ordinal variables are also coded as non-negative
integers if not already done. However, since ``distance'' from the reference
category plays an important role in this model, unobserved categories are not
collapsed after recoding.}

\item{y}{A data frame or matrix with \eqn{n_2}{n_2} rows and \code{p} columns
containing binary and ordinal responses for the second group. The variables
or columns in \code{y} must match the variables or columns in \code{x}. In
the paired samples design, the rows in \code{x} must match the rows in
\code{y}. Note that \code{x} and \code{y} are recoded independently, although
the function checks that the number of different responses observed matches
between \code{x} and \code{y}.}

\item{difference_selection}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, \code{bgmCompare} will
model the inclusion or exclusion of the between samples parameter
differences; if \code{FALSE}, it will estimate all between-sample
parameter differences. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{main_difference_model}{A string specifying options for how the
bgmCompare function should handle the comparison of threshold parameters when
the observed categories in the samples do not match. The "Collapse" option
tells bgmCompare to collapse the two categories into one (for the data set
where both categories were observed). The "Constrain" option sets the
difference between the category thresholds in the two data sets to zero if
the category is not observed in one of the two data sets. The "Free" option
tells bgmCompare to estimate a separate set of thresholds in the two samples
and to not model their differences.}

\item{variable_type}{A string or vector specifying the type of variables
in \code{x} (and \code{y}). Supported types are "ordinal" and "blume-capel",
with binary variables treated as "ordinal". Default is "ordinal".}

\item{reference_category}{The reference category in the Blume-Capel model.
Should be an integer within the range of integer values observed for the "blume-capel"
variable. Can be a single number that sets the reference category for all
Blume-Capel variables at once, or a vector of length \code{p}, where the
\code{i}-th element is the reference category for the \code{i} variable if
it is a Blume-Capel variable, and elements for other variable types are
ignored. The value of the reference category is also recoded when
`bgmCompare` recodes the corresponding observations. Required only if there
is at least one variable of type "blume-capel".}

\item{pairwise_difference_scale}{The scale of the Cauchy distribution that is
used as the prior for the pairwise difference parameters. Defaults to
\code{0.1}.}

\item{main_difference_scale}{The scale of the Cauchy distribution that
is used as the prior for the threshold difference parameters. Defaults to
\code{0.1}.}

\item{pairwise_difference_prior}{A character string that specifies the model
to use for the  inclusion probability of pairwise differences. Options are
"Bernoulli" or "Beta-Bernoulli". Default is "Bernoulli".}

\item{main_difference_prior}{A character string that specifies the model
to use for the  inclusion probability of threshold differences. Options are
"Bernoulli" or "Beta-Bernoulli". Default is "Bernoulli".}

\item{pairwise_difference_probability}{The inclusion probability for a
pairwise difference in the Bernoulli model. Can be a single probability or a
matrix of \code{p} rows and \code{p} columns specifying the probability of a
difference for each edge pair. Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{main_difference_probability}{The inclusion probability for a
threshold difference in the Bernoulli model. Defaults to 0.5, implying no
prior preference. Can be a single probability or a vector of length \code{p}
specifying the probability of a difference between the category thresholds
for each variable. Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{pairwise_beta_bernoulli_alpha}{The alpha parameter of the beta distribution
for the Beta-Bernoulli model for group differences in pairwise interactions.
Default is 1.}

\item{pairwise_beta_bernoulli_beta}{The beta parameter of the beta distribution
for the Beta-Bernoulli model for group differences in pairwise interactions.
Default is 1.}

\item{main_beta_bernoulli_alpha}{The alpha parameter of the beta distribution
for the Beta-Bernoulli model for group differences in category thresholds.
Default is 1.}

\item{main_beta_bernoulli_beta}{The beta parameter of the beta distribution
for the Beta-Bernoulli model for group differences in category thresholds.
Default is 1.}

\item{interaction_scale}{The scale of the Cauchy distribution that is used as
a prior for the nuisance pairwise interaction parameters. Defaults to
\code{2.5}.}

\item{threshold_alpha, threshold_beta}{The shape parameters of the beta-prime
prior density for the nuisance threshold parameters. Must be positive values.
If the two values are equal, the prior density is symmetric about zero. If
\code{threshold_beta} is greater than \code{threshold_alpha}, the distribution
is left-skewed, and if \code{threshold_beta} is less than \code{threshold_alpha},
it is right-skewed. Smaller values tend to result in more diffuse prior
distributions.}

\item{iter}{The function uses a Gibbs sampler to sample from the posterior
distribution of the model parameters and indicator variables. How many
iterations should this Gibbs sampler run? The default of \code{1e4} is for
illustrative purposes. For stable estimates, it is recommended to run the
Gibbs sampler for at least \code{1e5} iterations.}

\item{burnin}{The number of iterations of the Gibbs sampler before saving its
output. Since it may take some time for the Gibbs sampler to converge to the
posterior distribution, it is recommended not to set this number too low.}

\item{na.action}{How do you want the function to handle missing data? If
\code{na.action = "listwise"}, listwise deletion is used. If
\code{na.action = "impute"}, missing data will be imputed iteratively during
Gibbs sampling. Since imputation of missing data can have a negative impact
on the convergence speed of the Gibbs sampling procedure, it is recommended
to run the procedure for more iterations.}

\item{save}{Should the function collect and return all samples from the Gibbs
sampler (\code{save = TRUE})? Or should it only return the (model-averaged)
posterior means (\code{save = FALSE})? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{display_progress}{Should the function show a progress bar
(\code{display_progress = TRUE})? Or not (\code{display_progress = FALSE})?
The default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
If \code{save = FALSE} (the default), the result is a list of class
``bgmCompare'' containing the following matrices:
\itemize{
   \item \code{indicator}: A matrix with \code{p} rows and \code{p}
   columns containing the posterior inclusion probabilities of the differences
   in pairwise interactions on the off-diagonal and the posterior inclusion
   probabilities of the differences in category thresholds on the diagonal.
   \item \code{difference_pairwise}: A matrix with \code{p} rows and \code{p}
   columns, containing model-averaged posterior means of the differences in
   pairwise interactions.
   \item \code{difference_threshold}: A matrix with \code{p} rows and
   \code{max(m)} columns, containing model-averaged posterior means of the
   differences in category thresholds.
   \item \code{interactions}: A matrix with \code{p} rows and \code{p} columns,
   containing posterior means of the nuisance pairwise interactions.
   \item \code{thresholds}: A matrix with \code{p} rows and \code{max(m)}
   columns containing the posterior means of the nuisance category thresholds.
   In the case of ``blume-capel'' variables, the first entry is the parameter
   for the linear effect and the second entry is the parameter for the
   quadratic effect, which models the offset to the reference category.
 }

If \code{save = TRUE}, the result is a list of class ``bgmCompare''
containing the following matrices:
 \itemize{
   \item \code{indicator_pairwise}: A matrix with \code{iter} rows and
   \code{p * (p - 1) / 2} columns containing the inclusion indicators for the
   differences in pairwise interactions from each iteration of the Gibbs
   sampler.
   \item \code{difference_pairwise}: A matrix with \code{iter} rows and
   \code{p * (p - 1) / 2} columns, containing parameter states for the
   differences in pairwise interactions from each iteration of the Gibbs
   sampler.
   \item \code{indicator_threshold}: A matrix with \code{iter} rows and
   \code{sum(m)} columns, containing the inclusion indicators for the
   differences in category thresholds from each iteration of the Gibbs
   sampler.
   \item \code{difference_threshold}: A matrix with \code{iter} rows and
   \code{sum(m)} columns, containing the parameter states for the differences
   in category thresholds from each iteration of the Gibbs sampler.
   \item \code{interactions}: A matrix with \code{iter} rows and
   \code{p * (p - 1) / 2} columns, containing parameter states for the
   nuisance pairwise interactions in each iteration of the Gibbs sampler.
   \item \code{thresholds}: A matrix with \code{iter} rows and \code{sum(m)}
   columns, containing parameter states for the nuisance category thresholds
   in each iteration of the Gibbs sampler.
 }
Column averages of these matrices provide the model-averaged posterior means.

In addition to the results of the analysis, the output lists some of the
arguments of its call. This is useful for post-processing the results.

\description{
The \code{bgmCompare} function estimates the pseudoposterior distribution of
the parameters of a Markov Random Field model for mixed binary and ordinal
variables, and the differences in pairwise interactions and category thresholds
between two groups. The groups are assumed to be two independent samples.
}
\details{
In the first group, the pairwise interactions between the variables \eqn{i}{i}
and \eqn{j}{j} are modeled as
\deqn{\sigma_{\text{ij}} = \theta_{\text{ij}} + \delta_{\text{ij}} / 2,}{\sigma_{\text{ij}} = \theta_{\text{ij}} + \delta_{\text{ij}} / 2,}
and in the second group as
\deqn{\sigma_{\text{ij}} = \theta_{\text{ij}} - \delta_{\text{ij}} / 2,}{\sigma_{\text{ij}} = \theta_{\text{ij}} - \delta_{\text{ij}} / 2.}
The pairwise interaction parameter \eqn{\theta_{\text{ij}}}{\theta_{\text{ij}}}
denotes an overall effect that is considered nuisance, and attention is focused
on the pairwise difference parameter \eqn{\delta_{\text{ij}}}{\delta_{\text{ij}}},
which reflects the difference in the pairwise interaction between the two groups.

The \code{bgmCompare} function supports two types of ordinal variables, which
can be mixed. The default ordinal variable introduces a threshold parameter
for each category except the lowest category. For this variable type, the threshold parameter for
variable \eqn{i}{i}, category \eqn{c}{c}, is modeled as
\deqn{\mu_{\text{ic}} = \tau_{\text{ic}} + \epsilon_{\text{ic}} / 2,}{\mu_{\text{ic}} = \tau_{\text{ic}} + \epsilon_{\text{ic}} / 2,}
in the first group and in the second group as
\deqn{\mu_{\text{ic}} = \tau_{\text{ic}} - \epsilon_{\text{ic}} / 2,}{\mu_{\text{ic}} = \tau_{\text{ic}} - \epsilon_{\text{ic}} / 2.}
The category threshold parameter \eqn{\tau_{\text{ic}}}{\tau_{\text{ic}}} denotes
an overall effect that is considered nuisance, and attention is focused on the
threshold difference parameter \eqn{\epsilon_{\text{ic}}}{\epsilon_{\text{ic}}},
which reflects the difference in threshold of for variable \eqn{i}{i}, category
\eqn{c}{c} between the two groups.

The Blume-Capel ordinal variable assumes that there is a specific reference
category, such as ``neutral'' in a Likert scale, and responses are scored
according to their distance from this reference category. In the first group,
the threshold parameters are modelled as
\deqn{\mu_{\text{ic}} = (\tau_{\text{i1}} + \epsilon_{\text{i1}} / 2) \times \text{c} + (\tau_{\text{i2}} + \epsilon_{\text{i2}} / 2) \times (\text{c} - \text{r})^2,}{ {\mu_{\text{ic}} = (\tau_{\text{i1}} + \epsilon_{\text{i1}} / 2) \times \text{c} + (\tau_{\text{i2}} + \epsilon_{\text{i2}} / 2) \times (\text{c} - \text{r})^2,}}
and in the second groups as
\deqn{\mu_{\text{ic}} = (\tau_{\text{i1}} - \epsilon_{\text{i1}} / 2) \times \text{c} + (\tau_{\text{i2}} - \epsilon_{\text{i2}} / 2) \times (\text{c} - \text{r})^2.}{ {\mu_{\text{ic}} = (\tau_{\text{i1}} - \epsilon_{\text{i1}} / 2) \times \text{c} + (\tau_{\text{i2}} - \epsilon_{\text{i2}} / 2) \times (\text{c} - \text{r})^2.}}
The linear and quadratic category threshold parameters
\eqn{\tau_{\text{i1}}}{\tau_{\text{i1}}} and \eqn{\tau_{\text{i2}}}{\tau_{\text{i2}}}
denote overall effects that are considered nuisance, and attention is focused
on the two threshold difference parameters
\eqn{\epsilon_{\text{i1}}}{\epsilon_{\text{i1}}} and
\eqn{\epsilon_{\text{i2}}}{\epsilon_{\text{i2}}}, which reflect the differences
in the quadratic model for the variable \eqn{i}{i} between the two groups.

Bayesian variable selection is used to model the presence or absence of the
difference parameters \eqn{\delta}{\delta} and \eqn{\epsilon}{\epsilon}, which
allow us to assess parameter differences between the two groups. Independent
spike and slab priors are specified for these difference parameters. The spike
and slab priors use binary indicator variables to select the difference parameters,
assigning them a diffuse Cauchy prior with an optional scaling parameter if
selected, or setting the difference parameter to zero if not selected.

The function offers two models for the probabilistic inclusion of parameter
differences:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Bernoulli Model}: This model assigns a fixed probability of
  selecting a parameter difference, treating them as independent events. A
  probability of 0.5 indicates no preference, giving equal prior weight to
  all configurations.
  \item \strong{Beta-Bernoulli Model}: Introduces a beta distribution prior
  for the inclusion probability that models the complexity of the configuration
  of the difference indicators. When the alpha and beta shape parameters of the
  beta distribution are set to 1, the model assigns the same prior weight to
  the number of differences present (i.e., a configuration with two differences
  or with four differences is a priori equally likely).
  }
  Inclusion probabilities can be specified for pairwise interactions with
  \code{pairwise_difference_probability} and for category thresholds with
  \code{threshold_difference_probability}.

The pairwise interaction parameters \eqn{\theta}{\theta}, the category
threshold parameters \eqn{\tau}{\tau}, and, in the not yet implemented paired-samples designs,
the between-sample interactions \eqn{\omega}{\omega} are considered
nuisance parameters that are common to all models. The pairwise interaction
parameters \eqn{\theta}{\theta} and the between-sample interactions
\eqn{\omega}{\omega} are assigned a diffuse Cauchy prior with an optional
scaling parameter. The exponent of the category threshold parameters
\eqn{\tau}{\tau} are assigned beta-prime distribution with optional scale
values.
